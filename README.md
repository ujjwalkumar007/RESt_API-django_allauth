#What is this what I have to build?
###A course model, which will have basic data about the courses. It should be accessible via a rest API (CRUD). It should have ADD, EDIT, DELETE the course. The sample fields that can be included in the model are -
*Name of the course

*Date of the course
*Price of the course
*Users enrolled in this course

---
###A wishlist model, which will have a user and a course. The users can add any course they want to their wishlist, It should have ADD, EDIT, DELETE the user from the wishlist -
