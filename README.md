What is this what I have to build?
# A course model, which will have basic data about the courses. It should be accessible via a rest API (CRUD).
* Name of the course
* Name of the author
* Date of the course
* Price of the course
* Users enrolled in this course
# A wishlist model, which will have a user and a course.  -
* User showing all data about the user
* Course showing all data about the course
# A user, who can be logged in using TokenAuthentication. This should also be a CRUD API.
The following features are desirables - 
* Register
* Login
* Forgot Password
* Forgot Email
---
# My solution contain:-
* GET, POST, DELETE methods all working properly for courses and wishlist.
* Properly presented JSON formatted data.
* Comments and Docstrings, explaining what your code does.
* Course and Wishlist endpoints showing all the relative data property formatted.
